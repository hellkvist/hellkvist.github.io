I am a PhD student at the Division of Signals and Systems,
Department of Electrical Engineering at Uppsala University. 
I received my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Uppsala University in 2018.
My main research interests are signal processing and machine learning with overparameterized models,
and my latest publications include topics such as distributed learning and double descent.
